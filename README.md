# MusicSpeechClassification
Audio classifier for the GTZAN dataset, a small collection of 128 clips of both music and speech. Uses an AdaBoosted Support Vector Machine on the spectrogram representation of the audio files to achieve over 80% classification accuracy. Uses PCA to visualize the data, as well as K-Folds cross validation to ensure network doesn't overfit.
